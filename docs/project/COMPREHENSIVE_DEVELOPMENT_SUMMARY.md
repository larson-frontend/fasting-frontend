# Comprehensive Development Summary: Fasting App Full-Stack Implementation

## Project Overview
I have been working as a coding assistant on a comprehensive fasting tracker application consisting of:
- Frontend: Vue.js 3 + TypeScript + Vite (fasting-frontend)
- Backend: Spring Boot 3.3.2 + PostgreSQL + JWT Authentication (fasting-service)
- Deployment: Render.com platform with Docker containerization

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. Session Persistence & User Management
Problem: User had to re-enter username on every page refresh
Solution: Implemented comprehensive session management
- Enhanced getCurrentUser() method with localStorage persistence
- Added proper session restoration logic with backend validation
- Implemented selective logout (only on auth errors 401/403)
- Created robust error handling with fallback mechanisms

### 2. User-Specific API Integration
Problem: Active fasting sessions not showing in history, global endpoints causing issues
Solution: Complete user-specific endpoint architecture
- Converted all API calls to user-specific endpoints
- Backend: /api/fast/user/{identifier}/status, /history, /start, /stop
- Frontend: Parallel user-specific calls with global endpoint fallbacks
- Proper user identifier extraction (username || email)

### 3. TypeScript Error Resolution
Problem: GitHub Actions failing due to TypeScript compilation errors
Solution: Fixed type mismatches in mock services
- Corrected theme type from 'auto' to 'system' 
- Added missing mealReminders and progressUpdates to NotificationSettings
- Implemented feature flags for notification system (all set to false initially)

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
Problem: User requested layout changes
Solution: Header restructuring
- Removed leaf icon from right side
- Moved info button (i) from left to right side
- Clean layout: UserManager (left) + Info button (right)

### 5. Production Deployment Setup
Problem: Need reliable cloud hosting for PostgreSQL + Java backend
Solution: Render.com deployment optimization
- Created Docker-optimized build pipeline
- Implemented proper JDBC URL construction from individual DB env vars
- Added health check endpoint /actuator/health
- Optimized for free tier: tuned Hikari pool, JVM options
- Environment-based Spring profiles (no hardcoded CMD params)
